# 2048 game in python cmd
 We set out to recreate the 2048 game using python from scratch. The 2048 game is a tile numbered game where you combine
tiles of the same value to get a bigger valued tile. For example, you combine 2 with 2 to get 4 valued tile. The game 
ends when there are no more possible movement you can make.

To recreate or edit the game you will need to install the keyboard module.
